# REMI 2 - EWI MIDI Controller
Electronic Wind Instrument (EWI) - MIDI Controller using touch-pads for "keys" with recorder-like fingering scheme,
based on PIC18F45K22 (or PIC18F45K22) micro-controller, designed as a DIY project for electronics hobbyists.

REMI 2 is a simple MIDI controller with standard MIDI OUT connection (5-pin DIN socket). It does not have a built-in sound synthesizer.
A low-cost ($10) MIDI-USB adapter allows the REMI to be used with a "virtual synthesizer" (software app) running on a computer or mobile device.
Makers looking for an "all-in-one" EWI design featuring battery operation, built-in sound synth and speaker, should consider the REMI 3.
