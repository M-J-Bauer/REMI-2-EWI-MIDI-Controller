# REMI 2 - EWI MIDI Controller
Electronic Wind Instrument (EWI) - MIDI Controller using touch-pads for "keys" with recorder-like fingering scheme,
based on PIC18F45K22 (or PIC18F25K22) micro-controller, designed as a DIY project for electronics hobbyists.

REMI 2 is a simple MIDI controller with standard MIDI OUT connection (5-pin DIN socket). It does not have a built-in sound synthesizer.
A low-cost ($10) MIDI-USB adapter allows the REMI to be used with a "virtual synthesizer" (software app) running on a computer or mobile device.
Makers looking for an "all-in-one" EWI design featuring battery operation, built-in sound synth and speaker, should consider the REMI 3.

A full description of the project can be found in the doc folder. See also: http://www.mjbauer.biz/REMI_Intro.htm

REMI 2 firmware is built using Microchip's MPLAB.X IDE with XC8 compiler (free downloads from Microchip's website).
If you intend to modify or extend the firmware, you will need to install the full MPLAB.X IDE application. 
Otherwise, you just need to install the PIC programmer application (IPE) on your computer.
